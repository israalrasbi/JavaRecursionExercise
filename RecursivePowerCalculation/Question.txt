Objective: Create a recursive function to compute the value of a given base raised to the power of n. Both base and n are guaranteed to be 1 or more.

Requirements:

The function should be named powerN.

The input parameters are:

base: The number to be raised to the power of n.

n: The exponent.

The function must:

Return base if n = 1 (base case).

Recursively compute the result of base raised to n by multiplying base with the result of powerN(base, n - 1).

Avoid using loops.

Example Test Cases:

powerN(3, 1) → 3 (3 to the power of 1 is 3)

powerN(3, 2) → 9 (3 to the power of 2 is 9)

powerN(3, 3) → 27 (3 to the power of 3 is 27)
