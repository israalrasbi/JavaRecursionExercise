Objective: Create a recursive function that computes the length of the largest substring in a given string that starts and ends with a specified non-empty substring sub.

Requirements:

The function should be named strDist.

The input parameters are:

str: The string in which to search for the largest substring.

sub: The non-empty substring that the largest substring must start and end with.

The function must:

Return 0 if the string does not contain sub.

Recursively trim characters from the beginning and/or end of the string until the largest substring that starts and ends with sub is found.

Return the length of the resulting substring.

Avoid using loops.

Example Test Cases:

strDist("catcowcat", "cat") → 9 (The entire string starts and ends with "cat")

strDist("catcowcat", "cow") → 3 (Substring "cow" starts and ends with "cow")

strDist("cccatcowcatxx", "cat") → 9 (The substring "catcowcat" starts and ends with "cat")
