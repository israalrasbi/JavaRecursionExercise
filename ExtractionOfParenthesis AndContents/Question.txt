Objective: Create a recursive function that extracts and returns the substring starting from the first opening parenthesis ( and ending at the corresponding closing parenthesis ) from a given string.

Requirements:

The function should be named parenBit.

The input parameter is:

str: The string that contains a single pair of parentheses.

The function must:

Find and return the substring that starts from the first ( and ends at the matching ).

Recursively trim characters from the beginning and/or end of the string until the parentheses and their contents are isolated.

Avoid using loops.

Example Test Cases:

parenBit("xyz(abc)123") → "(abc)"

parenBit("x(hello)") → "(hello)"

parenBit("(xy)1") → "(xy)"
