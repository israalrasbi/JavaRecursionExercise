Objective: Create a recursive function that determines if an array of integers can be divided into two groups such that:

The sum of the two groups is equal.

All values that are multiples of 5 must be in one group.

All values that are multiples of 3 (but not multiples of 5) must be in the other group.

Requirements:

The function should be named split53.

The input parameter is:

nums: The array of integers.

The function must:

Return true if it's possible to divide the array into two groups with the same sum, under the given constraints.

Use recursion to explore different possibilities for splitting the array without using loops.

Use helper functions to manage the current sum of the two groups.

Example Test Cases:

split53([1, 1]) → true (Can divide into two groups with sums 1 and 1)

split53([1, 1, 1]) → false (Cannot divide evenly)

split53([2, 4, 2]) → true (Can divide into two groups with sums 4 and 4)
