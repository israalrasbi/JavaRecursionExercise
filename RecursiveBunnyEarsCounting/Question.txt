Objective: Create a recursive function to count the total number of ears for a line of bunnies. The line contains odd-numbered bunnies with 2 ears and even-numbered bunnies with 3 ears.

Requirements:

The function should be named bunnyEars2.

The input parameter n represents the total number of bunnies in the line.

The function must:

Return 0 if there are no bunnies (n = 0).

Recursively calculate the total number of ears:

If n is odd, add 2 ears for the current bunny and call the function for n - 1.

If n is even, add 3 ears for the current bunny and call the function for n - 1.

Avoid using loops or multiplication.

Example Test Cases:

bunnyEars2(0) → 0 (No bunnies)

bunnyEars2(1) → 2 (One bunny with 2 ears)

bunnyEars2(2) → 5 (One bunny with 2 ears, second with 3 ears)
